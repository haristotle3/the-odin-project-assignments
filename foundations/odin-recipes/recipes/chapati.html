    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Chapati</strong> (alternatively spelled chapathi), also known as
      roti, rooti, rotee, rotli, rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka, chapo (in East
      Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli (in Marathi), and roshi (in
      the Maldives), is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian
      subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan,
      Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the
      Caribbean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough
      with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called
      a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup hot water or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use
        a wooden spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough
        forms and add more water, if needed./li>
      </li>
      <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger
        chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Use a rolling pin to
        roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until
        bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds
        more.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
    </ol>
